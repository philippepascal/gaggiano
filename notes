current state:
coffee is decent, pressure control does something, though the readout on the screen is all over the place. need to figure out frequency of updates as controller sends more than screen receives
- let's add the use of Kalman filters to smooth out readings.
- increased greatly loop frequency to allow for many pressure readings.
temperature control seem iffy too. PID doesn't seem to find a way to stabilize at the right temp. often fall to bang bang range before bumping too high.
it would be real nice to see full logs of controller: all messages, with included readings, and outputs over time. would require logging on the screen in the SD card. maybe need to create new log file at every start.
logging would also probably require to not skip messages if several are logged in. multiple message reading and averaging for display might be good
channelling sometimes, already has a simple way to ease in pressure, not sure if it works great
steam pressure declines a lot, and PID instability doesn't help. should look at how to maintain a bit of pressure when steaming
cleaning cycle would be nice to have also, easily lifted from gaggiuino
