current state:
coffee is decent, pressure control does something, though the readout on the screen is all over the place. need to figure out frequency of updates as controller sends more than screen receives
- let's add the use of Kalman filters to smooth out readings.
- increased greatly loop frequency to allow for many pressure readings.
temperature control seem iffy too. PID doesn't seem to find a way to stabilize at the right temp. often fall to bang bang range before bumping too high.
look into kalman filter

- it would be real nice to see full logs of controller: all messages, with included readings, and outputs over time. would require logging on the screen in the SD card. maybe need to create new log file at every start.
- logging would also probably require to not skip messages if several are logged in. multiple message reading and averaging for display might be good

channelling sometimes, already has a simple way to ease in pressure, not sure if it works great
- steam pressure declines a lot, and PID instability doesn't help. should look at how to maintain a bit of pressure when steaming
- cleaning cycle would be nice to have also, easily lifted from gaggiuino

brew cycle:
1. instanciate pump low until pressure changes (detect water)
    this can't be done in screen...need special function and message
2. if blooming:
2.a. run pump low just enough to add a bit of water
2.b. wait blooming time
3. increase pump smoothly till brew pressure reached
    also needs to be done in controller. but probably ok on all brew cycles
4. run pump on PID until timer done, or button pressed
5. display brew run time for reference to set timer

- reset logs!!


timer on brew
 - start with display brew time
blooming!

 - add pump settings to advanced settings
 - persist steam settings
complete logs with additional settings
 - fix set temp on front panel when steaming
fix last brew time random showings
no header on logs
 - fix sudden drop in pump output. combined with gradual increase, causes massive "holes" in pressure profile
sometimes comms stop. no idea what is happening.
